The **Audio-Visual Playground** is a visualizer that uses frequency analysis to generate visualizes synchronized to music.

## Description

The visualizer uses Fourier mathematical analysis to determine the frequency components of a given audio signal.

This time-varying vector is then filtered through feature detecting filters which have been trained to identify particular beats and melodies in music.

The resulting data is then used as a seed in a visualizer.
